SCRIPTED / NETWORK
==================
"network" allows the motion-detector to be triggered via the network.
A use-case can be when for example one constatus-instance detect motion, that all
of them start recording (see also "exec-start").

constatus configuration example:
                trigger-plugin-file = "motiontrigger-plugins/netowkr.so.0.1";
                trigger-plugin-parameter = "1234";
1234 is the UDP-port it will listen on.
If a UDP-packet is received on that port (any packet, contents does not matter),
then the motion-detector gets triggered.


GPIO
====
"gpio" waits for a pulse on a GPIO pin, parameter is the gpio pin number to check

constatus configuration example:
                trigger-plugin-file = "motiontrigger-plugins/gpio.so.0.1";
                trigger-plugin-parameter = "13";
13 is the example GPIO-pin to listen on

This allows you for example to use e.g. a PIR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor )
to trigger the motion-detector.


TEMPLATE
========
"demo" is a template motion trigger in C++, always return false. 


OPENCV
======
"demoocv" is a filter using OpenCV; detecting areas
"demoocv2" is a filter using OpenCV; detecting human bodies


OBJECT-TEST
===========
This plugin checks the size of the moving objects.

constatus configuration example:
                trigger-plugin-file = "motiontrigger-plugins/objects-test.so.0.1";
		# percentage
                trigger-plugin-parameter = "5";


configuration example
---------------------
trigger-plugin-file = "motiontrigger-plugins/demo.so.0.1";
trigger-plugin-parameter = "my parameter";
